# Personal Website
The website is based on a quirky css aspect I came across [this website](https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html) once. When you `* { display: block; }`, you can display the information in the style and script tags. Combining that with some `tag::pre { content: '<tag>' }` and `tag::post { content: '</tag>' }`, you can make a website display it's whole source code (having some [Quine-iness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29) to it).

I used this aspect with some additional styling in order to create a simple personal website with the goal of redirecting people googling my name to the relevant projects or contact info.
